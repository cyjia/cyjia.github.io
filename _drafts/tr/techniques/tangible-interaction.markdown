# Tangible interaction

As the lines between hardware and software continue to blur, we see traditional computing increasingly embedded in everyday objects. Although connected devices are now ubiquitous in retail spaces, automobiles, homes, and workplaces, we still do not understand how to blend them into a useful computing experience that goes beyond a simple glass screen. Tangible interaction is a discipline that blends software and hardware technology, architecture, user experience, and industrial design. The goal is to provide natural environments made up of physical objects where humans can manipulate and understand digital data.
