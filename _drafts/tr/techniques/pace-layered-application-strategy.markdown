# Pace-layered Application Strategy

Gartner’s Pace-layered Application Strategy approach to architecture attempts to articulate the fact that decisions about architecture shouldn’t be a one-size fits all approach. Instead, it is important to take a balanced view to your technology portfolio in terms of where
to be conservative, and where to take risks. While we have qualms about some of the more prescriptive recommendations that seem to come with Pace, in general we like the concept and many organizations could benefit from adapting similar models.
