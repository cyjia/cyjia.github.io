# Property-based unit testing

We value unit testing on projects and we like techniques such as property-based unit testing which augment it. This is a practice of using data generators to create randomized inputs within defined ranges. It allows a quick check for boundary conditions and other unanticipated failure modes and has burgeoning support on multiple platforms.
