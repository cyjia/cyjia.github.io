# Moco

Testing HTTP-based micro-services can be painful and tricky. Particularly in two scenarios, the consumption of a group of micro-services from front-end, and the communication between micro-services. To deal with these, **Moco** can be handy. It is a lightweight stub framework for testing HTTP-based endpoints. You can have an embedded stubbed service up and running with 2 lines of Java or Groovy code, or a standalone one with few lines of JSON to describe the required behaviour.
