# Hystrix

Managing the web of dependencies in a distributed system is complicated, and is a problem more people are facing with the move to finer-grained micro-services. Hystrix is a library for the JVM from Netflix that implements patterns for dealing with downstream failure, offers real-time monitoring of connections, and caching and batching mechanisms to make inter-service dependencies more efficient. In combination with hystrix-dashboard and Turbine, this tool can be used to build more resilient systems and provide near-real time data on throughput, latency and fault tolerance.
