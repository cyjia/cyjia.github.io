# Go CD

Owing to the increasing interest in Continuous Delivery and deployment pipelines, we see many teams trying to extend their Continuous Integration tooling with plugins that provide deployment pipelines at a visual level. Go CD is a tool that was built with concept of deployment pipeline at its core. Go CD has the ability to sequence workflows both sequentially and in parallel at many levels, to execute specific tasks only on certain machines as well as to deterministically promote and propagate artifacts, which is a key enabler for Continuous Delivery. These are capabilities that most Continuous Integration tools lack, and we recommend that teams who might have otherwise tried to build a deployment pipeline from their Continuous Integration server try Go CD instead. Go CD was built by ThoughtWorks, is open-source, and is available for free for all teams(go.cd). The source code is available under the Apache 2.0 license(github.com/gocd/gocd).
