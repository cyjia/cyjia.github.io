# Consul

Consul (consul.io) makes it simple for services to register themselves and discover other services via DNS or HTTP. It scales automatically, with service look up locally or across data centers. Consul also provides a flexible key/ value store for dynamic configuration, with notification of configuration changes. The internal gossip protocol used by Consul is powered by the Serf library (serfdom. io), leveraging and building upon the membership and failure detection features.
