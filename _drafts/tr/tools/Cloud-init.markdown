# Cloud-init

Cloud-init is a simple but powerful technique for carrying out actions on a cloud instance at boot time. It is particularly useful when used with instance metadata to allow a newly booted instance to pull the configuration, dependencies and software needed to perform a particular role. When used together with the Immutable or Phoenix server pattern, this can create
a very responsive and light-weight mechanism for managing deployments in the cloud.
