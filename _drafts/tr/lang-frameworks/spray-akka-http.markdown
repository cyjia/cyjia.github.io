# Spray/akka-http

Spray/akka-http is a suite of lightweight Scala libraries providing client/server RESTful support on top of Akka. It fully embraces the Actor-, Future-, and Stream-based programming models used by the underlying platform. This lets you work on RESTful applications with idiomatic Scala code without worrying about wrapping around other Java libraries.
