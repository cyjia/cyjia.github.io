# Java 8

The team behind **Java 8** had to fight two battles: the community forces encouraging forever backwards compatibility (a long hallmark of Java) and the technical challenge of making a deep language change mesh with existing libraries and features. They succeeded on both fronts, breathing new life into the Java Language and placing it on par with other mainstream languages in terms of tunctional programming features. In particular, Java 8 has excellent syntactic magic that allows seamless interoperability between Lambda blocks, the new higher-order function feature, and SAM (Single Abstract Method) interfaces, the traditional way of passing behavior.
