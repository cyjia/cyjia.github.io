# R

R is traditionally used as stand alone analysis tool by research teams. With improvements in packages like Rook and RJSONIO, it has become trivial to wrap
the computational logic and expose it as an API. ThoughtWorks teams are using R as Compute platform to crunch large datasets in real time, using in-memory storage integrated with enterprise systems.
