# Scala, the good parts

Scala is a large language that is popular because of its approachability for new developers. This banquet of features is a problem because many aspects of Scala, like implicit conversions and dynamics, can get you into trouble. To successfully use Scala, you need to research the language and have a very strong opinion on which parts are right for you, creating your own definition of Scala, the good parts. You can disable the parts you do not want using a system called feature flags.
