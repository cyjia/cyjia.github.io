# Elixir

Elixir is a dynamic, functional, homoiconic programming language built on top of the Erlang virtual machine with a powerful macro system that makes it ideal for building Domain Specific Languages. Elixir has distinctive features such as the Pipe operator that allows developers to build a pipeline of functions like you would in the UNIX command shell. The shared byte code allows Ellixir to interoperate with Erlang and leverage existing libraries while supporting tools such as the Mix build tool, the lex interactive shell and the ExUnit unit testing framework. It is a practical alternative to Erlang for building DSLs.
