# TypeScript

TypeScript is an interesting approach to bringing a new programming language to the browser. With TypeScript, the new language features compile down to normal JavaScript, and yet as a superset of JavaScript it does not feel like a completely new language. It does not represent an either-or proposition and it does not relegate JavaScript to an intermediate execution platform. Many of the language features are based on planned future extensions of JavaScript.
