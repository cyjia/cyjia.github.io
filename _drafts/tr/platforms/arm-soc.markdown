# ARM SoC

AMD recently relaeased an 8-core ARM SoC(System on a Chip) designed for servers and has committed to releasing an ARM SoC with integrated graphics in 2015(anandtech.com/show/7989). ARM-based servers are an interesting alternative to x86 because they are significantly more energy efficient. For some workloads, building an ARM-powered Cloud is preferable.
