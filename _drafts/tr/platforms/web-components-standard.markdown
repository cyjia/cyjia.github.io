# Web Components standard

In the previous radar we cautioned against the use of traditional web component frameworks that provide a component model on the server side. The Web Components standard that originated at Google, is something quite different. It provides
an easier way to create recyclable widgets by helping with encapsulation of HTML, CSS and JavaScript, so they do not interfere with the rest of the page and the page does not interfere with them. Developers can use as much or as little of the framework as needed. Early support is provided by the Polymer Project.
