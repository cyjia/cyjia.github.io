# Two-factor authentication

Two-factor authentication significantly improves security over simple password-based systems. RFC 6238 — Time-based One-Time Password Algorithm (wikipedia. org/wiki/Time-based_One-time_Password_Algorithm) — is a standard for two-factor authentication. “Standard” authenticator apps from Google and Microsoft provide tokens to smartphone users, and there are a number
of other client and server implementations readily available. With providers such as Google, Facebook, Dropbox and Evernote using TOTP, there really is
no excuse to continue using simple password-based authentication where stronger security would be appropriate.
