# Espruino

Espruino is a microcontroller that natively executes JavaScript and thus lets the large number of JavaScript programmers get started very quickly. Using an event-based model similar to Node.js. Espurino devices can be very power efficient while still being responsive. Less powerful than a Raspberry Pi and slightly slower than an Arduino, Espruino makes an interesting alternative in low-power environments that need responsive behavior but can sacrifice some of the raw high level features and execution speed of those platforms.
