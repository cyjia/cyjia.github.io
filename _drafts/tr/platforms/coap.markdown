# CoAP

CoAP is an open standards communication protocol for the Internet of Things(IoT). While there is currently a proliferation of competing standards in the IoT space, we particularly like CoAP. It is specifically designed for resource-constrained devices and local radio networks. It uses UDP for transport, but is semantically compatible with HTTP. CoAP uses a web-based model of devices with their own URLs and a request-response paradigm that supports RESTful and decentralized approaches.
