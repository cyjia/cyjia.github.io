# OpenID Connect

OpenID Connect is a standard protocol for federated identity built on OAuth 2.0. It addresses a long-standing need for a simple, web-based protocol to exchange trusted authentication and authorization information. Previous standards like SAML or generic OAuth 2.0 have proven too broad and complex to ensure universal compatibility. Our hope is that OpenID Connect can provide a useful basis for secure access to RESTful microservices with authenticated end-user identity.
