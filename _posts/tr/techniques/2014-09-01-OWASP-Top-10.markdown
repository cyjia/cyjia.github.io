# OWASP Top 10

Barely a week goes by without the IT industry being embarrassed by yet another high profile loss of data, leak of passwords, or breach of a supposedly secure system. There are good resources to help with making sure security gets treated as a first-class concern during software development and we need to stop ignoring them; the OWASP Top 10 is a good place to start.

* OWASP Top 10 – 2013 (New)
 Open Web Application Security Project
* A1 – Injection
* A2 – Broken Authentication and Session Management
* A3 – Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
* A4 – Insecure Direct Object References
* A5 – Security Misconfiguration
* A6 – Sensitive Data Exposure
* A7 – Missing Function Level Access Control
* A8 – Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
* A9 – Using Known Vulnerable Components
* A10 – Unvalidated Redirects and Forwards
