# cloud lift and shift

As cloud adoption grows we are unfortunately seeing a trend to treat the cloud as just another hosting provider. This cloud lift and shift trend is unfortunately being encouraged by large vendors re-branding existing hosting offerings as “cloud.” Few of these offer any real flexibility or pay-as-you-use pricing. If you think you can move to the cloud without re-architecting you are probably not doing it right.
