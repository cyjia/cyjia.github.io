# Elm

Elm is a functional programming language that is used to build web based user interfaces in a functional reactive style. Elm is strongly statically typed and built on the Haskell platform. Elm has a Haskell-like syntax but compiles down to HTML, CSS and JavaScript. While still in its very early days, individuals and teams interested in exploring highly interactive web based GUIs should look into this interesting little language.
