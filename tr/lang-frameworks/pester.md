# Pester

PowerShell remains a widely used option for doing low-level automation on Windows machines. Pester is a testing library that makes it possible to execute and validate PowerShell commands. Pester simplifies testing of scripts during development with a powerful mocking system that makes it possible to setup stubs and doubles in tests. Pester tests can also be integrated into a continuous integration system to prevent regression defects.
