# Python 3

Python 3 was a major change from the previous Python 2.x that introduced backwards incompatible changes. It was notable for actually removing languages features to make it easier to use and more consistent, without reducing its power. This has led to problems in adoption, as some of the supporting libraries people rely on have not been ported, and Python developers often have to find new ways of doing things. Nonetheless the drive towards making a language simpler is to be applauded, and if you are actively developing in Python, then give Python 3 another look.
