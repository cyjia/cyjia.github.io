# Go language

The **Go language** was originally developed by Google as a system programming language to replace C & C++. Four years out, Go is gaining traction in other areas. The combination of very small, statically linked binaries combined with an excellent HTTP library means Go has been popular with organization making use of finer-grained, micro-service architectures.
