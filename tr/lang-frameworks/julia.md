# Julia

Julia is a dynamic, procedural and homoiconic programming language designed to address the needs of high performance scientific computing. The implementation of the language is organized around the concept of generic functions and dynamic method dispatch. Julia programs are largely functions that
can contain multiple definitions for different combinations of argument types. The combination of these language features and the LLVM based just-in-time compiler help Julia achieve a high level of performance. Julia also supports a multiprocessing environment based on message passing to allow programs to run on multiple processes. This enables programmers to create distributed programs based on any of the models for parallel programming.
