# Tailored Service Template

We see multiple organizations creating a Tailored Service Template which can be used to quickly seed new services, pre-configured to operate within that organizationâ€™s production environment. The template contains a default set of decisions such as web frameworks, logging, monitoring, build, packaging, and deployment approaches. This is a very useful technique for encouraging collaborative evolution while retaining lightweight governance.
