# Capturing client-side JavaScript errors

**Capturing client-side JavaScript** errors has helped our delivery teams identify issues specific to a browser or plug-in configuration that impact user experience. Over the past year a number of service providers have started to surface in support of this requirement. Other than storing these errors in application data stores, web applications can log this data to web analytics or existing monitoring tools such as New Relic to offload storage requirements.
