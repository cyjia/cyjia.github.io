# Humane Registry
A Microservice architecture by itâ€™s very nature increases significantly the number of applications, services, and interactions in your deployed environments.
Our projects are showing renewed focus on building Humane Registries (martinfowler.com/bliki/ HumaneRegistry.html) which aggregate information about running services from the live environment and present it in a form for humans to comprehend. These registries favor up-to-date information from running services instead of human-curated documentation.
