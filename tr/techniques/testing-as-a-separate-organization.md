# Testing as a separate organization

We continue to see organizations create separate Development and QA teams. Fast feedback is a core tenet of Agile and critical to the success of a project. Using a separate QA team slows down this feedback, creates an "us and them" mentality and makes it more difficult to build quality into the software. Testing should be a tightly integrated activity and isnâ€™t something the team can outsource. We recommend integrated teams where testers work closely with developers instead of having testing as a separate organization.
