# DevOps Team

Some companies with good intentions create a separate DevOps team, which misconstrues the definition of DevOps. Rather than a role, DevOps is a cultural movement encouraging collaboration between operations specialists and developers. Rather than create yet another silo and suffer the consequences of Conwayâ€™s Law, we advise you to embed these skills into teams, improving feedback loops and communication pathways by removing friction.
