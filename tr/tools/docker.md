# Docker
The Docker open-source project has generated a great deal
of interest within ThoughtWorks, and is growing in momentum and maturity. Docker allows applications to be packaged and published as portable lightweight containers that run identically on a laptop or a production cluster. It provides tooling for the creation and management of application containers, and a run-time environment based on LXC (LinuX Containers).
