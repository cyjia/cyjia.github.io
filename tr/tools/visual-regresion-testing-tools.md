# Visual regression testing tools

Growing complexity in web applications has increased the awareness that appearance should be tested in addition to functionality. This has given rise to a variety of visual regression testing tools, including CSS Critic, dpxdt, Huxley, PhantomCSS, and Wraith. Techniques range from straightforward assertions of CSS values to actual screenshot comparison. While this is a field still in active development we believe that testing for visual regressions should be added to continuous delivery pipelines.
