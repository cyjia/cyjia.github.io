# Papertrail

Papertrail is a log aggregation service that aggregates data from a variety of sources including web-servers, routers, databases and PaaS services. In addition to aggregation it provides search, filtering, and alerts and notifications out of the box. While undeniably convenient and expedient in many cases, we remain concerned about widespread adoption of services that centralize large quantities of data aggregated from multiple parties.
