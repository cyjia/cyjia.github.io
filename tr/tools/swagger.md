# Swagger

Swagger (helloreverb.com/developers/swagger) is a standard way to describe a RESTful API so that documentation and client examples can be generated automatically. We think there’s a need for some standards in this area and hope that this approach embraces Postel’s law and avoids the tight-coupling and inflexibility of standards like WSDL. A number of tools are now available to render documentation and client pages from swagger-compliant descriptions (github.com/ wordnik/swagger-ui).
