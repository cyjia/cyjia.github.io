# Prototype On Paper

We have long favored the use of hand-drawn, low fidelity prototypes to illustrate user interactions without getting caught up in the nitty-gritty of the graphic design. **Prototype On Paper** is a tool that allows individual mockups drawn on paper to be captured via camera on IOS or Android and linked together to allow for testing of user interaction. This bridges the gap nicely between the static, lo-fi paper prototypes and more hi-fi prototyping techinques.
