# Spark

For iterative processing such as machine learning and interactive analysis, Hadoop map-reduce does not work very well because of its batch-oriented nature. Spark is a fast and general engine for large-scale data processing. It aims to extend map-reduce for iterative algorithms and interactive low latency data mining. It also ships with a machine learning library.
