# IBeacons

iBeacons are the Apple implementation of the broader category of beancons, which are small devices that use low energy Bluetooth(BLE) to provide fine-grained proximity information for mobile phones and other devices. Despite the hype surrounding iBeacons and the limitations to the accuracy and reliability of the information they provide, we do feel that they open interesting opportunities as trigger points for interacting with your users in a contextually relevant manner.
