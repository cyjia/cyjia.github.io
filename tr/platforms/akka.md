# Akka

**Akka** is a toolkit and runtime for building highly concurrent, distributed, and fault tolerant event-driven applications on the JVM. It offers very lightweight event-driven processes with approximately 2.7 million actors per GB RAM and a "let-it-crash" model of fault-tolerance designed to work in a distributed environment. Akka can be used as a library for web-apps or as a stand-alone kernel to drop an application into.
