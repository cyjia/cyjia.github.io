# Storm

Heterogeneous and overwhelmingly large amounts of data is not the only theme of big data. In certain circumstances, speed of processing can be as important as the volume. Storm is a distributed realtime computation system. It has similar scalability to Hadoop, with throughput as fast as a million tuples per second. It enables for real time processing what Hadoop does for batch.
