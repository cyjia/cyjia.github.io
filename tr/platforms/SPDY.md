# SPDY

SPDY is an open networking protocol for low-latency transport of web content proposed for HTTP2 that has seen a rise in modern browser support. SPDY reduces page load time by prioritizing the transfer of subresources so that only one connection is required per client. Transport layer security is used in SPDY implementations with the transmission headers gzip or deflate compressed instread of human-readable text in HTTP. It is great for high-latency environments.
