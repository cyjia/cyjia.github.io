# EventStore

Given the popularity of event sourcing, it is no surprise that tools in this space are maturing. EventStore(geteventstore.com) is an open source functional database for storing immutable events and performing complex event processing on the event streams. Unlike other tools in this space, EventStore exposes event streams as Atom collections which therefore require no special infrastructure such as message buses or highly specialized clients to use.
